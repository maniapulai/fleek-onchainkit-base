## Fleek + OnchainKit with Base & Jstack

## Overview

This project integrates **OnchainKit** and the **Base Pixel** font on Fleek, leveraging the **Base Pixel** typeface for an expressive and digital-native experience. Additionally, the project is deployed using Fleekâ€™s Next.js adapter, ensuring edge-optimized performance and decentralized hosting.

## Technologies Used

- **OnchainKit**: A toolkit for onchain interactions
- **Base**: Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum
- **Base Pixel Typeface**: A custom font created by Baseâ€™s Creative Office and ClÃ©ment Cases
- **Fleek Next.js Adapter**: Deployment solution for Next.js applications

## Base Pixel Typeface

**Base Pixel** is a unique typeface designed by **ClÃ©ment Cases** in collaboration with **Base's Creative Office**. It plays with the contrast between traditional typography and the digital world, with each weight representing a 'degradation' of resolution. Minting the Base Pixel NFT provides access to the font and a full commercial license. All proceeds go to the designer.

## Running the Template Locally

To run this template locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd base-fleek
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=
   ```

   You can obtain the `ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY` from your [CDP dashboard](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys/client-key).

5. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment with Fleek

This project uses **Fleekâ€™s Next.js adapter** for seamless deployment to the Fleek Network.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (Version 18+)
- **Fleek CLI** (Version 3+)
- **Next.js Application**

### Installation

To install the Fleek Next.js adapter, run:

```sh
# Using npm
npm install @fleek-platform/next

# Global installation
npm install @fleek-platform/next -g
```

### Configuring Edge Runtime

For server-side routes, configure the runtime:

```js
export const runtime = "edge";
```

### Building the Application

Use the Fleek Next.js adapter to build your project:

```sh
npx fleek-next build

# Or if installed globally
fleek-next build
```

If running the command outside the project root, specify the path:

```sh
fleek-next build -p path/to/my/repo
```

### Deploying the Application

1. **Create a Fleek Function**:

   ```sh
   fleek functions create
   ```

   Note the function name for the next step.

2. **Deploy the Application**:
   ```sh
   fleek functions deploy --bundle=false --path .fleek/dist/index.js --assets .fleek/static
   ```
   If not logged in, you will be prompted to log in and select your project.

### Deployment Output

Upon successful deployment, you will receive a Fleek Function URL:

```sh
âœ… Success! Deployment completed.
ðŸ”— https://your-deployment.functions.on-fleek.app
ðŸ”— https://fleek.network/services/your-ipfs-hash
```
